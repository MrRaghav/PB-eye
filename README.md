# PB-eye - The Eyedropper

_It rhymes with PBI as it is focussed on Power BI which doesn't have an inbuilt eyedropper as of 2025!_

**PB-eye** is a lightweight, smart color **eyedropper** designed for Power BI users and designers. Hover over any color, copy its hex code instantly with **Shift + C**, and paste it anywhere using **Ctrl + V**. PB-eye sits neatly at the bottom-right corner of your screen, giving you fast, frictionless color picking without interfering with your workflow.

## Features:

- **Hover, Copy & Instant Paste:** Hover over any color on your screen and copy its hex code with a single keystroke (**Shift + C**). Then, paste copied hex codes anywhere with **Ctrl + V**.

- **Floating Tooltip:** Always-visible tooltip shows copy/paste instructions.
